LDLite is a lightweight, open source reporting tool for FOLIO
services. It is part of the Library Data Platform project and
provides basic LDP functions without requiring the server to be
installed.

LDLite supports two modes of usage.
* Ad-hoc uses a local DuckDB to enable downloading small amounts of data and querying using sql.
* Server uses a persistent postgres server and managed cron server to download large amounts of data for analytic processing and reporting.

### Usage with a persistent postgres server

See the [Five Colleges Setup](https://github.com/Five-Colleges-Incorporated/ldlite-scripts) for an example of automating overnight data loads.

It is recommended to install the `psycopg[c]` package for optimal reliability and performance in a server context.

### Usage for ad-hoc local querying

To install LDLite or upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
$ python -m pip install --upgrade ldlite
```

(On some systems it might be `python3` rather than `python`.)
Check out the [migration guide](./MIGRATING.md) for more information about major version upgrades.

*Optional* If you intend to use the `connect_db_postgres()` method install the binary provider:
```
$ python -m pip install --upgrade psycopg[binary]
```

To extract and transform data:

```python
$ python
>> > import ldlite
>> > ld = ldlite.LDLite()
>> > ld.connect_folio(url='https://folio-etesting-snapshot-kong.ci.folio.org',
                      tenant='diku',
                      user='diku_admin',
                      password='admin')
>> > db = ld.connect_db()
>> > _ = ld.query(table='g', path='/groups')
ldlite: querying: / groups
ldlite: created
tables: g, g__t, g__tcatalog
>> > ld.select(table='g__t')
```

```

```python

            FROM u__t
                JOIN g__t ON u__t.patron_group = g__t.id;
        """)
>> > ld.export_csv(table='user_groups', filename='groups.csv')
```

Features
--------

* Compatible with DBeaver database tool
* Compatible with DuckDB and PostgreSQL database systems
* PostgreSQL support enables:
    * Sharing the data in a multiuser database
    * Access to the data using more database tools
    * Storing the data in an existing LDP database if available
* Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
