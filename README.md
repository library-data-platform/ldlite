LDLite is a lightweight, open source reporting tool for Okapi-based
services. It is part of the Library Data Platform project and
provides basic LDP functions without requiring the server to be
installed.

To install LDLite or upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
$ python -m pip install --upgrade ldlite
```

(On some systems it might be `python3` rather than `python`.)

> [!Warning]
> The legacy /auth/login endpoint with a non expiring token is going to be removed in the Sunflower release.
> In the next release of this library the default endpoint to be used will be the newer /authn/login-with-expiry.
> Because of these changes the connect_okapi_token method will no longer function and will be removed with the release of Sunflower.
> For more information on these changes see: https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FOLIJET/pages/1396980/Refresh+Token+Rotation+RTR

To extract and transform data:

```python
$ python
>> > import ldlite
>> > ld = ldlite.LDLite()
>> > ld.connect_okapi(url='https://folio-juniper-okapi.dev.folio.org/',
                      tenant='diku',
                      user='diku_admin',
                      password='admin')
>> > db = ld.connect_db()
>> > _ = ld.query(table='g', path='/groups', query='cql.allRecords=1 sortby id')
ldlite: querying: / groups
ldlite: created
tables: g, g__t, g__tcatalog
>> > ld.select(table='g__t')
```
